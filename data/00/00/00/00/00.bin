  |   A game about shapes, and about beats.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   "Just Shapes & Beats" is a chaotic co-op musical bullet-hell based    |
  |   on three simple things: avoid Shapes, move to the rad Beats, and      |
  |   die, repeatedly. It's a new spin on SHMUPs, adding a layer of coop    |
  |   that's at the core of the game: 'cause everything is better with      |
  |   friends.                                                              |
